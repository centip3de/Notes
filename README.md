Notes
--

A small mark-up language meant to help with taking well formatted notes quickly on a computer. It's currently pretty bad code and lacking of features. 

* Planned features:
    * GUI for seeing how notes look
    * Indexing of important notes (defintions, sections, etc.)
    * Quick jumping to indexed notes
    * Making the parser pretty
